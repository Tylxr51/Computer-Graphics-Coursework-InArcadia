### Hello!

In this repo ( https://github.com/Tylxr51/Computer-Graphics-Coursework-InArcadia ) you will find my coursework project for CS324: Computer Graphics.

In the solution folder you will find all of the html, css, and js files used for the project, as well as the assets required for the game.

The game launches from the main() call in main.js.
